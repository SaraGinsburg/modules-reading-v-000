CODE ALONG I: INCLUDING MODULE METHODS AS INSTANCE METHODS
This is a code along exercise. Fork and clone this repo by clicking the Github link at the top of the page. Follow along with the walk-through below to get your code working. Get the tests to pass.

STEP I: DEFINING OUR MODULE
We'll code our Dance module inside the lib/dance_module.rb file. Open up that file and define your module with the following code:

module Dance
end
Let's give our Dance module some fabulous moves:

module Dance
  def twirl
    "I'm twirling!"
  end

  def jump
    "Look how high I'm jumping!"
  end

  def pirouette
    "I'm doing a pirouette"
  end

  def take_a_bow
    "Thank you, thank you. It was a pleasure to dance for you all."
  end
end
